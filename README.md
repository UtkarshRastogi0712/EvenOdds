# Problem Statement
Online Blockchain based dynamically updating fantasy portal. 

# üí° **Our Solution**
Our concept integrates traditional fantasy league book making with the decentralised world. Our implementation reduces risk for book makers by dynamically updating odds in realtime as users play along and stake their claims. In traditional book making, the book maker has to continously monitor the odds, and stakes placed on the odds to reduce the risk and balance their "vig" or payout. This portal automates the process of changing odds to balance bets. 

## **Concept**:
- The payout of the bookmaker longterm is the vigorish or "vig" they charge over the payouts of the bet winner.
- The bookmaker ensures a payout by increasing the sum of probabilities for all the options, which should come out to be 1 by a certain percentage above 1.
- This reduces the odds by an ensured margin that forms the "vig" of the book maker.
- The "vig" itself does not ensure a lower risk as a high value stake on an option with very high odds does pose a significant risk of the bookmaker having to payout more than the earnings of the values staked.
- Given the bookmaker cannot control the spread of the bets across the options, they adjust the odds to make certain options more lucrative than others and spread out the bets to ensure a better payout.
- Our solution ensures
